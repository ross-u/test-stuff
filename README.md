# CSS | Slack clone with Flexbox

## Introduction

**Slack** is a cloud-based set of team collaboration tools and services, or in simpler terms, an online chat application.

We use the Slack app almost every day to keep our communications with our classmates and the **Ironhack** team, but today we will be focusing on their landing page. In today's lab, we'll recreate Slack's landing page while ensuring it's responsive and adapts well to different screens. You can see the web page that we will be cloning [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=125%3A3&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=125%3A2&starting-point-node-id=125%3A3&hide-ui=1).



The goal of the lab is to create a *responsive* landing page using **CSS** and **Flexbox**.




## Requirements

- Fork this repo

- Clone this repo

  

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create a Pull Request so that your TAs can check your work.



## Instructions

The `starter_code` folder contains all the files you'll need. The `images` folder contains all the images you'll need for your page, although most of them are already displayed on the page.



**The `index.html` already contains all the text and content needed.  We will be focusing on the CSS and styling!**



During each iteration, the first step you should do is to inspect the provided screenshots. These are included in each iteration, along with a preview of the final result. Use these as a starting point for implementing your styles.

## Iteration 0 | Introduction to Figma

The first step during every iteration will be to inspect the design files. These were created using Figma and are usually handed off to developers by designers. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a web-based UI (User Interface) design tool, used for creating design prototypes for websites and applications.

Figma is great because it allows designers and developers to collaborate on projects while also making it simple to share and preview web page designs.

When you begin working as a developer, your team will likely use Figma to hand off  to you the designs of the features you will be asked to create. We're going to assume you've never seen Figma before, so don't worry. The following short videos should get you up to speed:

### Iteration 1 | Mobile Screens (width < 768px)

Mobile first right? :wink: 

We will start by focusing on the styles for mobile screens first! :iphone: Oh! Remember to use **Flexbox** to create the layout and display the content in rows or columns from the start. You'll be working on adapting the layout to different screen sizes in the following iterations, so it's essential that you start using Flexbox from start to end!



<br>

When done, your page should look like this: <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=68%3A2762&scaling=scale-down&page-id=68%3A2761&starting-point-node-id=68%3A2762&show-proto-sidebar=1&hide-ui=1" target="_blank">Preview - Mobile</a>



<br>

Use the following page screenshot as the guide:

### Iteration 2 | Small Screens (width > 768px and width < 1024px)

Let's start growing our screen size. In this iteration, you will work on making the website look great on small screens (iPads, tablets, or larger smartphones). You will have to use CSS [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to apply the style and layout changes. Take a look at the preview and the screenshot to see the changes that are needed. Your task is to work on the following:



- The **header** should go from 1 column to display 2 columns: one with the content and buttons, and the other with the image.
- The **company logos** should be displayed in a single row.
- The **images** in the sections in the **main** part should be fully displayed and aligned to the left or right side of the page, respectively.
- The **section "Teams large and small rely on Slack"** should have the list items and the buttons displayed horizontally as rows.
- The **sub-footer** items, previously displayed as a column, should now be displayed in a single row.



<br>

When done, your page should look like this: <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=49%3A1508&scaling=scale-down&page-id=68%3A2976&starting-point-node-id=49%3A1508&hide-ui=1" target="_blank">Preview - Small Screens</a>

### Iteration 3 | Medium Screens (width > 1024px and width < 1440px)

We'll continue by focusing on devices with medium-sized screens (notebooks and bigger tablets). Similar to the previous iteration, you will have to use CSS media queries to apply the style and layout changes. The most noticeable changes for this viewport size are:



- The **navbar** should now display all the menu links. The previously displayed menu icon should now be hidden.
- The **sections** in the **main** part should now display the content in 2 columns: one column for the heading and text, and the other for the image.
- The **section "Welcome to your new digital HQ"** should now have the buttons displayed horizontally as rows.



<br>

When done, your page should look like this: <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=49%3A2159&scaling=scale-down&page-id=68%3A2977&starting-point-node-id=49%3A2159&hide-ui=1" target="_blank">Preview - Medium Screens</a>

### BONUS: Iteration 4 | Large Screens (width > 1440px)

Last one! Some small changes and we are done! In this iteration we are targeting large-screen devices such as desktops and laptops:



- The **signup buttons** in the **header** should now be displayed horizontally, next to each other.

- Additionally, the image shown in the **header** should be centered and fully visible.

  

<br>

When done, your page should look like this: <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=49%3A2489&scaling=scale-down&page-id=68%3A2978&starting-point-node-id=49%3A2489&hide-ui=1" target="_blank">Preview - Large Screens</a>
